# Small-Plugins
In this repository you will find some plugins by Gamecrafter that were rejected by the PocketMine site, but most of them were
made just for fun. The rejected plugins have been made into example plugins simply for the benefit of all of those who want to
write their own plugins. Most of the plugins here were made in either 30 minutes or less.
