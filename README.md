# Example-Plugins
In this repository you will find some plugins that were rejected by the PocketMine site, but most of them were made just for
fun. The rejected plugins have been made into example plugins simply for the benefit of all of those who want to write their own
plugins. Most of the plugins here were made in either 30 minutes or less. Some may also be modified or renamed versions of other
existing plugins.
