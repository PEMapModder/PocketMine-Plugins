# Example-Plugins
A collection of Gamecrafter's rejected plugins from the PocketMine site, some just made for fun. The rejected plugins have been
made into example plugins simply for the benefit of all of those who want to write their own plugins. Most of the plugins in 
this repository were made in either 30 minutes or less. Some may also be modified or renamed versions of other existing plugins.
